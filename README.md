# GoF Design Patterns: PHP implementation

In this project, I am trying to help myself understand and use Gang of Four design patterns using some PHP implementation.

These are some resources I used to create these examples:   
Clean Code book for Uncle Bob.   
Modular Programming with PHP 7 for Branko Ajzele.   
Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns
